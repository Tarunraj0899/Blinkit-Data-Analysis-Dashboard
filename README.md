# Blinkit-Data-Analysis-Dashboard
I developed a Power BI dashboard for Blinkit to analyze sales, outlet performance, and product insights. The project involved data cleaning, transformation using Power Query, and DAX for calculated metrics. Key KPIs like total sales, average sales, and item counts are visualized with interactive filters for insights.
